# Credit Risk Classification
 
WORK IN PROGRESS

Our goal is to use Machine Learning techniques to solve the above task. Financial institutions are nowadays risk-averse and they need to estimate the risk involved when giving out credit to their customers. In addition, they need to be in the position to justify why they have either accepted or rejected a credit application due to regulatory requirements.

The dataset has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/german-credit
